An Arcade Space Shooter game made with Unity 2019.1.1f and C# scripting. Navigate through a star-lit bullet hell and blast your enemies! Collect coins with which to improve your arsenal and defenses! A re-imagining of "Endless Space", one of my previous projects, this time a bit more challenging.


Controls:

- WASD or arrow keys to move around.
- Left click to fire blasts.
- Right click to launch rockets.


How to play:

- Avoid getting hit: you only have three lives.
- Your shield will protect you. Spend ten seconds without getting hit for it to recharge.
- Use your arsenal to destroy enemies, then collect the coins they leave behind.
- Survive 60 seconds to upkeep your lives, health, rockets, shield capacity and shield recharge rate using the coins you've collected.
- Each round will increase the amount of enemies that come after you by double the previous amount. Think you're up to it?
